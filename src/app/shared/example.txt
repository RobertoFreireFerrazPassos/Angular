Shared Module:
The SharedModule is where any shared components, pipes/filters and services should go. 
The SharedModule can be imported in any other module when those items will be re-used. 
The shared module shouldn’t have any dependency to the rest of the application and 
should therefore not rely on any other module.

Components:
The components folder contains all the “shared” components. This are components like loaders and buttons , which multiple components would benefit from.

The directives , pipes and models folders contains the directives, pipes and models used across the application.
